                                <p>We're a German student-run nonprofit organisation
                                    focused all around coding and
                                    hacking. We try to bring a bit of silicon valley to the german
                                    computer-science and start-up community by disrupting the status quo. We do this by organising hackathons, coding boot camps
                                    and other similar events.
                                </p>

                                    backgrounds: Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Economics, Business, and
