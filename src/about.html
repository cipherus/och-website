                                <p>
                                    This event is about turning a museum into a place of creativity and creation.
                                    Our dream is to motivate new people to join the hack community and to provide an event where
                                    young hackers can work on their dreams of their own little pet projects, while
                                    experienced hackers can compete for prices in ambitious categories.
                                    We want to unite participants from all kinds of backgrounds. We designers,
                                    organizers and artists to join the community of developers.
                                    We just want to people to unfold all the
                                    creativity they have in an inspiring environment.

                                    and shows a nice selection of artifacts that layered the ground for our daily digital world.
                                    Opencodes is always open for the public and free of charge. It presents a unique atmosphere for working and getting inspired.

                                    We're a German student-run nonprofit organisation
                                    focused all around coding and
                                    hacking. We try to bring a bit of silicon valley to the german
                                    computer-science and start-up community by disrupting the status quo. We do this by organising hackathons, coding boot camps
                                    and other similar events.
                                    Our team consists of students from a variety of
                                    backgrounds: Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Economics, Business, and
                                    more.</p>
