                                <p>
                                    This event is about turning a museum into a place of creativity and creation. We want to motivate new people to join the hack community and provide a event where young hackers can fulfill their giant dreams of their own little pet projects.
                                    The people we want to attract can come from basically every kind of being that exists, from designers, organisers up to developers and artits. We just want to people to enfold all the creativity they buffered the last few years.

                                    The ZKM is a Karlsruhe based museum, that presents a unique mixture of wonderful architecture and refreshing new art. The current exhibition is called opencodes and shows a nice selection of artifacts that layered the ground for our daily digital world. Opencodes is always open for everyone and presents a good atmosphere for working and getting inspired. A perfect place for a hackathon!

                                    We're a German student-run nonprofit organisation
                                    focused all around coding and
                                    hacking. We try to bring a bit of silicon valley to the german
                                    computer-science and start-up community by disrupting the status quo. We do this by organising hackathons, coding boot camps
                                    and other similar events.
                                    Our team consists of undergraduates from a variety of
                                    backgrounds: Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Economics, Business, and
                                    more.</p>
