                                    It's about turning a museum into a place of creation and innovation.
                                    We want to motivate people to join the hacking community and provide an event where
                                    young hackers can work on their own pet projects, while
                                    experienced hackers can compete for prizes in ambitious categories.

                                    We want people to pour all their creativity into their project in an inspiring environment.

                                    The hackathon is hosted at the center of the open codes exhibit of the ZKM
                                    media museum in Karlsruhe. Sounds borring? Read on, I dare you, I double
                                    dare you (you know what comes next).

                                    The exhibit isn't just any museum exhibit, instead it is filled with all kinds of toys
                                    and gadgets from VR goggles to impressive media artworks. The exhibit is a daring
                                    attempt at making the world of devs, designers and makers more accessible to the general public. It does this byff
                                    The ZKM is a small media museum that bridges the gap between art, technology and design
                                    with its ever changing and truly unique exhibits. In its small niche it has gained global
                                    attention, in fact the New York Times dubbed as â€œan institution that has no exact
                                    parallel in the world and not even a recognizable echo in America."


                                    It presents a unique atmosphere for working and getting inspired.
                                    A perfect place for a hackathon!

                                    We're a German student-run nonprofit organisation
                                    focused all around coding and
                                    hacking. We try to bring a bit of silicon valley to the german
                                    computer-science and start-up community by disrupting the status quo. We do this by organising hackathons, coding boot camps
                                    and other similar events.
                                    Our team consists of students from a variety of
                                    backgrounds: Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Economics, Business, and
