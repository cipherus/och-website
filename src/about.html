                        <p>
                            The hackathon is radically different from other hackathons, because it is part of
                            an experimental tech exhibit hosted by a unique media museum.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We're talking about <a class="white-link" href="https://open-codes.zkm.de/en"
                                                   target="_blank">Open Codes - Living in Digital Worlds</a>
                            of the <a class="white-link" href="http://zkm.de/en" target="_blank">ZKM</a> in Karlsruhe.
                            Unlike what you may think, it is not boring. In fact, it's
                            filled with all kinds of awesome toys and gadgets, from VR goggles to mind-blowing
                            interactive digital art. The exhibit sheds light on the world of devs, designers and
                            makers, making the tech community more accessible to the general public.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            As we all know, tech becomes ever more important, and yet it
                            still has such a tough barrier of entry. We want to help change that, and to do so
                            we needed something new. We had to <span style="color: #FF3524">rethink</span> our hackathon.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Our approach: we make sure everyone, techies as well as museum visitors and everyone else
                            is welcome at the OpenCodes Hackathon. Anyone can come visit the exhibit to see that
                            a bunch of people sitting in a dark room with their
                            hoods up is very far from the reality. Neither are we evil hackers who will steal your bank
                            account. Instead hackathons have one of the coolest atmospheres, and that's what visitors
                            will discover. We want to fascinate non-tech people with tech, and inspire
                            them to join our ranks as hackers. Join us and be a part in this unique experiment.

                            We want to motivate as many people as possible to join the hacking community. We want to
                            provide an event where young hackers can work on their own pet projects, while experienced
                            hackers can compete for prizes in ambitious categories.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We want to unite participants from all kinds of backgrounds. We want designers,
                            organizers and artists to join the community of hackers and makers.
                            We want people to pour all their creativity into their project in an inspiring environment.

                            with its ever changing and truly unique exhibits. In its small niche it has gained global
                            attention, in fact the New York Times dubbed as â€œan institution that has no exact
                            parallel in the world and not even a recognizable echo in America."

                        <p>
                            We're a German student-run nonprofit organisation
                            focused all around coding and
                            hacking. We try to bring a bit of silicon valley to the german
                            computer-science and start-up community by disrupting the status quo. We do this by
                            organising hackathons, coding boot camps
                            and other similar events.
                            Our team consists of students from a variety of
                            backgrounds: Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Economics, Business, and
                            more.</p>

                            We do the doing, talKIT does the talking. It's an amazing tech conference where people from
                            all kinds of backgrounds come together to discuss one big topic. This year it's AI & cybersecurity,
                            so get pumped!
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            TalKIT takes a look at this topic from many different angles, not just tech. It's a great
                            experience and tons of fun. However you should know that the entire event is in German.
                            <br/>

                            Further more, the winners of the hackathon are invited to join the talKIT conference and
                            present their project. If you've got questions about them, please hit them up here.
