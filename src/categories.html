                        Our trademarks at Hack & Söhne are diversity, collaboration and low entry barriers.
                    With the categories we present here, we want to make this vision a reality. <br>
                        This is why our "Hack & Söhne" main category is totally free of limitations and guidelines. Whatever you
                        have in mind will certainly fit into this category. <br>
                        For those looking to solve more specific problems there are the three categories powered by our partners.<br>

                                <p>In a world that grows more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous, integration is the key to cope with the challenges arising with every new possibility. So, we are looking for inventive ways to combine technologies, business sectors, value chains, ecosystems, data, assets or even cultures.

                                    Big ideas need a lot of bridging between things that don't seem to naturally belong together: in a smart city, millions of devices need to communicate not only with each other, but also bring information from the material world into the digital. To build new solutions in mobility and transport, we have to cross borders in a technical sense as well as in the user's experience. To live peacefully in a global society, we have to embrace and integrate different cultures and enable decentral communities, grids and communication.

                                    We want you to build the first step towards a more connected future, enabling cutting-edge use cases, or making new things possible within the old. We value passion, creativity in applying technologies, novelty and disruptive potential, but also outstanding teamwork. The winner of our challenge can look forward to hacker-approved prizes.

                                    To help you build the technology of tomorrow, we provide you with useful APIs and data. Come to our booth to get an introduction or help from our experts. Let's shape the future by connecting worlds!</p>

                            So in the end it's up to you, how you spend your time.
                            Just make yourself comfortable and we're sure, that you'll create awesome stuff!
