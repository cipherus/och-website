                    <p>Where do apps come from? What is it like to program? Unfortunately for most of the population
                        programming resembles more black art than anything familiar. We want to change that! Inside the ZKM,
                        in the fantastic Open Codes Exhibition, our hackathon takes place. Various teams will work
                        under pressure to bring their projects to life. They've only got 28 hours to go from an idea to
                        a prototype. This is a unique chance for you to actually observe how software is made. This includes seeing
                        all the sweat, occasional tears and the constant problem-solving present during such competitions.<br>
                        As we mentioned before, the hackathon is directly embedded into the Open Codes Exhibition.
                        The Open Codes - <span>living in digital worlds</span> Exhibition tries to visualize the hidden
                        algorithms and structures that shape our digitalized and globalised world.
                        A perfect environment to complement our hackathon.

                    <h2 class="pb3 f3"><b>So, <span style="color: #10C4EE">what is a hackathon</span> exactly?</b></h2>
                    <p>The rules are simple: The teams have 28 hours to build their idea, and are not allowed to start working
                        until the hackathon begins. In the end the results get judged under various criteria including
                        originality of the idea and quality of the implementation.<br>
                        What sets us apart from other hackathons is that we don't restrict the projects
                        of our participants to a certain topic (like healthcare or industry 4.0), but rather encourage any out-side-of-the-box ideas.
                        Even more unique is the deep cooperation with the ZKM. We encourage our participants not only to create interesting tech, but
                        also combine it with art.
