                    <p>A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is a design sprint-like event in
                        which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic
                        designers,
                        interface designers, project managers, and others, often including subject-matter-experts,
                        collaborate intensively on software projects.</p>

                        The goal of a hackathon is to create usable software. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus,
                        which can include the programming language used, the operating system, an application, an API,
                        or
                        the subject and the demographic group of the programmers. In other cases, there is no
                        restriction on
                        the type of software being created.</p>
